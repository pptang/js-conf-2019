<div style={{ fontSize: '1.6rem'}}>that allows users to enjoy buying and selling.</div>

---

Every marketplace app has a common problem...

---

## Why this page is so critical?

- Essence of a marketplace App (Buy & Sell)
- Directly affect the convertion to GMV $$$
- A lot of business logic involved

---

## What makes heavy business logic?
(Illustration)
- Buyer & Seller
- Different types of transaction (clothes, smartphone, furniture, car)
- Different Delivery Methods
- Transaction Progress (Payment -> Delivery -> ? -> Review -> Finish)

---

<AnimationSlide title="Let's do Re-Architecture"/>

---

## Mercari Webview Architecture
(Draw artchitecture)

---

## Re-Architecture - Target

- Turn spaghetti code into more maintainable, readable, and less WTF code.
  (Use emoji or GIF or whatever)
- Good Test coverage.
- Better UI/UX with design system in mind.

---

## Start from Scratch or Migrate Page by Page

---

Considering it's Transaction Page...

# We go for Migrate Page by Page!

---

## Problems for current codebase

- Background
  - Knockpout.js + jQuery + HTML/CSS
- A huge file with all business logic
  - (img: Show lines of code screen shot)
- Mix business logic and display logic in an imperative way
  - (img: show sample ko if: html code)
- Hard to maintain (trace) the code
  - Bad encapsulation (show many Hows in the code instead what or why)
  - Magic numbers, literal strings are scattered everywhere

---

# Single File Application

---

# Find the divisible unit
(Draw pie chart)

---

## Target
  - Can be released as independent business case
  - Easy to co-work as team
  - Easy to add/remove

---

## Map to code splitting

# "How to handle those logicðŸ¤”?"

---

# Display Logic v.s Buiness Logic

---

<AnimationSlide title="Power of Layers"/>

---

# Let's go through the whole business scenario first!

---

## After an item is bought...
As a buyer, I want to check my transaction page.

---

## Maybe I want to do sth with it later...
But I first I need to see it first.

---

## Cuz it's a webview, so the way to entry is a url

---

<img src={routing} style={{ width: '1000px' }} />

---

## Blueprint Layer to show the overall layout

---

<img src={blueprintLayer} style={{ width: '1000px' }} />

---

## Smart Container to handle display logic

---

<img src={smartContainer} style={{ width: '1000px' }} />

---

## Dumb Component to be minumum display unit (atomic, discuss with designer, storybook)

---

<img src={dumbComponent} style={{ width: '1000px' }} />

---

# Display Logic

---

## Let's think about next possible flow

---

As a buyer, I'd like to ask a question about the product I want to buy.

---

1. I'll type in the message in the comment box.
2. I'll see a dialog box confirming if I really want to send this message.
3. After clicking confirmed button, I expect my message will be sent and stored some whatever
4. If something goes wrong, I expect to see some error messages.
5. If everything goes well, I expect to see all sent messages on the page.

# Business Logic

---

Separate imperative from declarative!
(Although you can argue that even if you isolate the business logic inside sagas, those should still be written in a declarative way,
but I personally think declarative is more like relative concept, you can always to be more abstract and more high-level speaking of writing code,
but the UI and the display of a page are inherently more declarative than other logics. We describe UI as "There is XXX on the page" and "There is a XXX button here",
it cannot be the other way around.)
Benefit:
1. When tracing issues, it would be easier to pinpoint the problem
2. Easier to write test (different test strategy, re-think the legacy code which mix ko-if with ui)

(Table)

Display Logic vs Business Logic
Display:
  - show the transaction page
   - BluePrint Layer -> Enzyme with shallow rendering
   - Smart Container Layer -> No test (too brittle)
   - Dumb Component -> Storyshot
Business Logic:
  - Sagas test -> the use scenario I mentioned before
End to end test:
  - Use describe chat as example -> make it the same as the use scenario I mentioned before

---

<img src={testSagas} style={{ width: '1000px' }} />

---

<img src={testE2e} style={{ width: '1000px' }} />

---

Storyshot -> hard to read but sometimes still catch some bad rendering result
Sagas test -> Really hard to read and maintain -> thinking to remove
E2E tests -> Easy to read and good protection of the codebase

---

## Testing Strategies

- Unit Test -> Storyshot, enzyme to test display logic
- Sagas Test -> to test business logic
- Cypress Test -> to test whole user flow (whole story) -> story as a cypress spec

---

## Challenges

- Adding new features and Doing Re-Architecture at the same time
- Supported Platforms, Accessibilities
  (As a leading second-handed marketplace app, we have to support wide range of platforms) -> we don't want to lose any market shares
- Performance Issues -> Especially transaction page -> better code splitting and setting performance budget

---

## Current Result

- 60% of item transaction page is migrated to new codebase.

---

## Roadmap
- Move to Web
  - How putting business logic in sagas can help, how different layers of logic can help.
- Apply Design System
  - How Different unit of view component can help

---

## Conclusions
- Architecture is about different layers, make reasonable decisions to separate layers can make your codebase easier to maintain and test.
- It's quite challenging to add new feature and do re-architecture at the same time, so better do one thing at a time.

---

## Key Takeaways

- How to model your problems, find possible solutions and go for one which suits you best.
- How to separate the concern, make good use of different layers for better team workign and easy-to-maintain codebase.
- How to utilize different strategies for testing and sleep well.
